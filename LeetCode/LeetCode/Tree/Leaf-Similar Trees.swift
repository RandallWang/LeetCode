/**
     Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

     For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).
 
     Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.
 
     Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.
 
 
 
     Note:
 
     Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
